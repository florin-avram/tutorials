# Intent
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide
a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
 
# Motivation

# Applicability
Use decorator pattern:
* to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently
* for responsibilities that can be withdrawn
* to avoid an explosion of subclasses to support every combination.

# Structure
